Hi, I'm Aaron Cheung

A passionate software engineer and artist.

As a recent graduate from The University of Texas - Dallas with a degree in Computer Science, I've developed skills in Web Development and UX Design through both academic coursework and personal projects driven by curiosity and genuine interest. My portfolio showcases a mix of university projects and independent work, all refined and polished to demonstrate my capabilities as a developer. Each project reflects not just technical competency, but also my approach to problem-solving and design.

Beyond coding, I have a strong interest in Graphic Design and Art. Creating visually unique or aesthetically pleasing compositions exercises the limits of my imagination, giving me the freedom to create in ways that are both functional and intriguing.

The projects I've done come from a mix of independent curiosity and required coursework and most of them can be found here or on my portfolio aaroncheung.me
