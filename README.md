Hi, I'm Aaron Cheung

A passionate software engineer and artist.

Although I'm still studying computer science at The University of Texas - Dallas, lots of my skills such as Web Development and UX Design come from my personal pursuit of things that have interested me in the past.

Another great interest of mine is Graphic Design and Art. Creating visually unique or aesthetically pleasing compositions excersises the limits of my imagination, giving me the freedom to create in ways that are both functional and intriguing.

The projects I've done come from a mix of independent curiosity and required coursework and most of them can be found here or on my portfolio aaroncheung.me
